Question - 5.5\\


If each element of a second order determinant is either zero or one , what is the probability that the value of the determinant is positive ? (Assume that the individual entries are chosen independently each value being assumed with probability 1/2 )\\


Solution :\\


Total number of entries in a second order determinant are 4. Let us assume that the entries of the matrix be {a,b,c,d} in the order respectively.\\
\begin{center}
 Matrix M = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
   a & b \\ c & d
  \end{bmatrix}  
\end{center}\\

Let X be a random variable ='The value of the entry'.The set of values which X can hold are {0,1}.\\
Then the probability of X being 0 is P(X=0) = 1/2.\\
Probability of X being 1 is P(X=1) = 1/2.\\

For the determinant of the matrix M  =  (ad - bc) to be positive with possibilities as 1 or 0 both a and d should be 1 and at least one among b and c should be 0 . \\

Probability of both a and d to be 1 is 1/4(as P(X=1)=1/2).\\
Probability of at least one among b and c not equal to 1 is 3/4.\\

Therefore the required probability for the determinant of the matrix to be positive is 
\begin{center}
     = 1/4 * 3/4\\=3/16\\
\end{center}
